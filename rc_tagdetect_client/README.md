ROS client for Roboception's tag detection modules
==================================================

**This package is not developed anymore**. New clients are available in the
[rc_reason_clients_ros repository](https://github.com/roboception/rc_reason_clients_ros/tree/master/rc_reason_clients#rc_april_tag_detect_client-and-rc_qr_code_detect_client).

This node provides ROS service calls and parameters for TagDetect node.
For detail description of the TagDetect check rc_visard manual: https://doc.rc-visard.com/latest/en/tagdetect.html

Installation
------------

On Debian/Ubuntu add the ROS sources and

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rc-tagdetect-client
```

### From Source

This package relies on git submodules for the cpr library which need to be initialized before building from source.

~~~bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~

Configuration
-------------

### Parameters

* `device`: The ID of the device, i.e. Roboception rc_visard sensor. This can be either:
  * serial number, e.g. `02912345`.
    IMPORTANT: preceed with a colon (`:02912345`) when passing this on the commandline or
    setting it via rosparam (see https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1339).
    This is not neccessary when specifying it as a string in a launch file.
  * user defined name (factory default is the name of the rc_visard's model), must be unique among all
    reachable sensors.
* `host`: If `device` is not used: The IP address or hostname of the rc_visard

### Dynamic reconfigure parameters

* `use_cached_images`: Use most recently received image pair instead of waiting for a new pair.
* `forget_after_n_detections`: Number of detection runs after which to forget about a previous tag during tag re-identification.
* `max_corner_distance`: Maximum distance of corresponding tag corners in meters during tag re-identification.
* `quality`: Quality of tag detection (H, M or L).
* `detect_inverted_tags`: Detect tags with black and white exchanged.
* `publish_visualization`: Whether or not the tf and markers should be published.


Services
--------

The following services are offered by the node:

* `detect`: Triggers single detection.
* `start_continuous_detection`: Starts continuous detection.
* `stop_continuous_detection`: Stops continuous detection.


Launching
---------

Using command line parameters:

~~~
rosrun rc_tagdetect_client rc_april_node _device:=:<serial_number>
rosrun rc_tagdetect_client rc_qr_node _device:=:<serial_number>
~~~
