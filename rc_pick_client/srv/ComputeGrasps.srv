# Description: Triggers the computation of grasp poses for the given items and suction surface.

# A valid pose_frame (either camera or external) is required in the request.
# It can be provided either with the pose_frame field, as pose_frame of the selected region of interest
# or as pose_frame of the selected load carrier.
# If more than one pose_frame is provided, they must to be consistent.

# Optional. Pose frame for output poses.
string pose_frame

string region_of_interest_id

string load_carrier_id

# Optional
Compartment load_carrier_compartment

# Optional. If empty, means one item of type unknown without dimensions
ItemModel[] item_models

# Required. Dimensions of the gripper suction surface
# In case of circular suction cups, the two values are expected to be the same and set to the suction cup diameter
# Different values are expected for grippers with multiple suction cups or non-circular suction cups (e.g. oval cups)
float64 suction_surface_length
float64 suction_surface_width

# Required only if reference frame = external and sensor is robot-mounted
