ROS Hand-eye calibration client for Roboception's rc_visard
=========================================================

**This package is not developed anymore**. A new client is available in the
[rc_reason_clients_ros repository](https://github.com/roboception/rc_reason_clients_ros/tree/master/rc_reason_clients#rc_hand_eye_calibration_client).

This node provides ROS service calls and topics to calibrate the rc_visard to a robot (aka hand-eye calibration).

It also provides the new or pre-existing calibration via `/tf` or `/tf_static`.
The default behavior is to request the existing calibration of the rc_visard
once on startup, broadcast it (latched) on `/tf_static` and only broadcast again
if the advertised ROS services `calibrate` or `get_calibration` are called.

The calibration routine consists of several steps:

1. Setting calibration parameters, i.e. grid size and mounting, via dynamic reconfigure.
2. For a user-defined number of robot calibration poses repeat

    1. Move the robot to the pose (calibration grid must be visible in the rc_visard's view).
    2. Send the robot pose to rc_visard (`set_pose`)

3. Trigger the calibration tranformation to be calculated (`calibrate`).

After the calibration transform is calculated and tested, it should be saved to the rc_visard (`save_calibration`).

For detailed instructions on the calibration routine consult the rc_visard manual: https://doc.rc-visard.com.

Installation
------------

On Debian/Ubuntu add the ROS sources and

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rc-hand-eye-calibration-client
```

### From Source

This package relies on git submodules for the cpr library which need to be initialized before building from source.

~~~bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~

Configuration
-------------

### Parameters

* `device`: The ID of the device, i.e. Roboception rc_visard sensor. This can be either:
  * serial number, e.g. `02912345`.
    IMPORTANT: preceed with a colon (`:02912345`) when passing this on the commandline or
    setting it via rosparam (see https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1339).
    This is not neccessary when specifying it as a string in a launch file.
  * user defined name (factory default is the name of the rc_visard's model), must be unique among all
    reachable sensors.
* `host`: If `device` is not used: The IP address or hostname of the rc_visard that should be calibrated.
* `rc_visard_frame_id`: Name of the frame on the rc_visard when calibrating. Default: "camera"
* `end_effector_frame_id`: Name of the frame calibrated to when using a `robot_mounted` (see below) rc_visard. Default: "end_effector".
* `base_frame_id`: Name of the frame calibrated to when using a statically (externally) mounted rc_visard (`robot_mounted == false`). Default: "base_link"
* `calibration_request_period`: Decimal number, controls the requesting of calibration from the rc_visard. Default: 0.0
  * If positive: Interval in seconds for automated requests to get the latest calibration.
  * If zero: Only request once on startup (default).
  * If negative, the calibration is never requested.
  * In any case, new results will be broadcast when the services `calibrate` or `get_calibration` (see further below) of this node are called.
* `calibration_publication_period`: Decimal number, controls broadcasting of the calibration on `/tf` or `/tf_static`. Default: 0.0
  * If positive: Interval in seconds.
  * If negative or zero, the calibration is broadcast on `/tf_static` only when changed in a manual or periodic calibration request (default).

### Dynamic reconfigure parameters

* `grid_width`: The width of the calibration pattern in meters.
* `grid_height`: The height of the calibration pattern in meters.
* `robot_mounted`: Whether the camera is mounted on the robot or not.
* `tcp_rotation_axis`:, TCP rotation axis for 4 DOF robot calibration (-1 for general robot)
* `tcp_offset`: Offset from the TCP for 4 DOF robot calibration

Services
--------

The following services are offered to follow the calibration routine:

* `reset_calibration` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/Trigger]: Deletes all previously provided poses and corresponding images. The last saved calibration result is reloaded. This service might be used to (re-)start the hand-eye calibration from scratch.
* `set_pose` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/SetCalibrationPose]: Provides a robot pose as calibration pose to the hand-eye calibration routine.
* `calibrate` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/Calibration]: Calculates and returns the hand-eye calibration transformation with the robot poses configured by the `set_pose` service. Broadcasts the result via `/tf` or `/tf_static`.
* `get_calibration` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/Calibration]: Returns the existing hand-eye calibration transformation. Broadcasts the result via `/tf` or `/tf_static`.
* `save_calibration` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/Trigger]: Persistently saves the result of hand-eye calibration to the rc_visard and overwrites the existing one. The stored result can be retrieved any time by the get_calibration service.
* `remove_calibration` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/Trigger]: Removes the stored hand-eye calibration on the rc_visard. After this call the `get_calibration` service reports again that no hand-eye calibration is available. Periodic broadcasting via `/tf` will be stopped.
* `set_calibration` [rc_hand_eye_calibration_client/SetCalibration]: Sets the hand-eye calibration transformation. The calibration transformation is expected in the same format as returned by the `calibrate` and `get_calibration` calls. `save_calibration` must be called to make the calibration transformation persistent.

Launching
---------

Using command line parameters:

~~~bash
rosrun rc_hand_eye_calibration_client rc_hand_eye_calibration_client_node _device:=:<serial_number>
~~~
